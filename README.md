# BudgetTracker

## Description

Budget Tracker is a progressive web application that allows the user to tracker their expenses. They can add or subtract funds from their overall budget and track it all on a chart and table diaplyed on the page. The user can even use the application without a connection to the server and the values will be stored locally and then added to the database when the connection is restored.

Here is a link to my deployed application: https://vast-hollows-89882.herokuapp.com/
